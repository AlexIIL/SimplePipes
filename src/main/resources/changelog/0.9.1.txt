Changes:

* Added support for rotating pipes and facades by block rotation methods.
* Enabled code that converts all pipe blocks into multiparts for improved compatibility and maintainability.
* Fixed issues with multipart pipes not updating their shapes.
* Fixed some instances of facade z-fighting.
* Improved part placement ghosts.
* Added EMI compatibility. (Prevents facades from cluttering up the EMI side panel.)
